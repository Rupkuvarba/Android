# Android studio

It is a specialized workshop with tools to make it easy for software developers to use to design, build, run, and test apps for the Android platform. 

Android Studio uses IntelliJ IDEA as its foundation and includes the Android plugin pre-installed along with some tweaks specifically for the Android platform, so it will feel very familiar to you.

Note: Although the look of the installation dialogs and icons may change with the different versions of Android Studio, the installation steps should basically remain the same.

# Emulatore

Note: The Android Emulator is an independent application used to set up a virtual device, and it has its own system requirements. Virtual devices can use up a lot of disk space.
